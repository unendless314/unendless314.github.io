## Lin: The survivor of a rug-pulled memecoin community 🐼

![Desktop View](/pictures/common/lin-profile.webp){: width="972" height="589" .w-50 .right}

大家好，我是林君樵，是禅宗熊猫基金会（ZenPandaCoin Foundation）中仅存的志愿工作者，由于创办人 Bill 的发币实验而加入社区 🥰

目前项目已遭遗弃且币价一落千丈，本人决定接手实验，将以国宝熊猫为主题的华人迷因币发扬光大 🐼

与来自 [**Screaming into the Night**][Screaming into the Night] 的合作伙伴 Jeff 几经讨论后，规划把禅宗熊猫的叙事定位在东方玄学和西方的超能力领域 🧘🧘‍♂️🧘‍♀️

准备乘着身心灵产业的兴起与即将到来的外星人揭秘事件，让禅宗熊猫再次取得市场关注和流动性 🛸

此外，我们也正筹备一系列灵能（Psionics）相关的产品服务，帮助地球人有效地学习和发挥念能力 🧙‍♀️

每周禅宗熊猫都会举办遥视比赛（Remote Viewing），对基础灵能有兴趣的朋友不妨试试 👁️

若您有任何灵能相关的需求也随时欢迎联系，禅宗熊猫将竭诚为您服务 🙏

## Jeff: The Wandering Wizard of Remote Viewing 🧙‍♂️

![Desktop View](/pictures/common/jeff-profile.webp){: width="972" height="589" .w-50 .left}

Welcome to ZenPandaCoin, where remote viewing meets wizardly flair and a dash of Chinese tradition. 🐼

I’m Jeff, the founder of [**Screaming into the Night**][Screaming into the Night] and your guide to exploring the mysterious world of psychic powers. 🔮

Over the years, I’ve honed my remote viewing skills through trial, error, and plenty of amusing mishaps (let’s not even talk about my lottery and casino adventures). 🎲

Now, I’m here to help curious souls get a glimpse into the future—without overthinking it. 👻

If you’re ready to explore the unknown, have a good laugh, and maybe see what the universe has in store for you, drop me a message and let’s see where the signal line takes us. 😉

Remember, as a wandering wizard once said: A little foresight never hurt anyone, unless you’re betting on rugby. 💰

## Birdie: The Novice Spirit Keeper on a Remote Viewing Adventure 🐈

![Desktop View](/pictures/common/birdie-profile.webp){: width="972" height="589" }

Hey there! I’m Birdie, your friendly neighborhood remote viewer-in-training. 👩‍🎓

My journey into the world of Remote Viewing has just begun—three views in, and I’m already feeling the magic. ✨

Besides, I’m also a Spirit Keeper, offering oracle readings to help people connect with their spirit guides. 🧞🧞‍♀️🧞‍♂️

My mission is to become a top-notch guide, helping others navigate the mysteries of the paranormal and supernatural realms. 💀😈🎃👹👻

I’m constantly learning to peer beyond the ordinary and expanding the ESP toolkit for those curious enough to explore the unknown. 🧐📚🔮

Check out my metaphysical treasure trove at [**blackbirdrituals on Instagram**][blackbirdrituals on Instagram] or find me on [**Threads**][Threads].

Who knows, I might just be the one to find your missing socks next! 😄

## Ora: A Loving Christian Mother with Out-of-This-World Experiences 👽

![Desktop View](/pictures/common/leora-profile.webp){: width="972" height="589" .w-50 .right}

Step into the unknown with me! I’m Ora, a proud Christian mom with a little more than your everyday experiences. Between mysterious encounters with unseen forces and the occasional “borrowing” by aliens, life around here is anything but ordinary. 🛸

As a self-taught remote viewer, I’ve honed my ability to peek beyond the physical world. And when I’m not diving into the unknown, you’ll probably find me in the kitchen whipping up some bacon-wrapped chicken tenders or a creamy tortellini soup. 🍲

Life with my wonderful daughter Lilly keeps me grounded — even when things start floating around the house on their own. 👻

Whether it’s shadowy figures or unexplained voices, let’s just say my home holds more than a few secrets! 🔮

If you’re curious about the paranormal or need a little help navigating those spooky experiences, feel free to reach out. I’m always here to lend a hand — or share a recipe. 🙌
