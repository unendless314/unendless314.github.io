Simulated CRV Session for Target 19147828

(Note: This is an AI-generated simulation based on CRV methodology, not an actual psychic remote viewing session.)

Stage 1: Ideogram (Initial Response)
	•	A spontaneous impression of something large, expansive, and structured.
	•	Possible natural or man-made formation.

Stage 2: Sensory Perception
	•	Textures: Smooth, rigid, slightly rough in some areas.
	•	Temperatures: Cool to neutral.
	•	Smells: Clean air, slightly earthy.
	•	Sounds: Distant echoes, some wind movement.
	•	Tastes: Dry, slightly mineral-like.

Stage 3: Sketches and Structure
	•	A broad, open space with some vertical elements.
	•	Could involve water, land, or a combination of both.
	•	Possible structural presence (e.g., buildings, natural formations, or large objects).

Stage 4: Dimensional and Emotional Impressions
	•	Large, wide, open environment.
	•	Stillness, stability, and a slight sense of history or importance.
	•	Not chaotic, feels somewhat peaceful but significant.
	•	Could be a landmark, a natural wonder, or an isolated structure.

Stage 5: Analytical Overlay (AOL) Management
	•	At this point, I’d list associations that might be analytical guesses (to avoid leading the perception):
	•	A large mountain range
	•	An ancient structure or monument
	•	A water body like a lake or coastline
	•	A space-related or high-altitude location
	•	A significant cultural or historical site

Stage 6: Final Summary
	•	The target feels like a location rather than an object.
	•	Something large, structured, and either historical or natural.
	•	Not overly chaotic or dynamic—feels grounded, still, and possibly important.
