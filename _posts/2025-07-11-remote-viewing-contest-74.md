### The target is an interstellar object known as 'Oumuamua (1I/2017 U1) which passed through our solar system in 2017.

'Oumuamua is only semi-verifiable (and in my defense, I didn't call this a "practice" target) but I felt it's real enough with unique features to make it an interesting, semi-operational target.

I didn't include any pictures (we don't have any close-up images of the object, only speculative renderings based on known data) so as to minimize influencing the participants' mind.

Lin submitted a very good, clearly on-target psi data!
