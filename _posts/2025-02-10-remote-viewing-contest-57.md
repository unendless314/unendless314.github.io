Felt like there were entities spinning in that funnel. General EI: dreadful. I don't think that's physical lighthouse, only a metaphor. Curious to know what it represents...

Controlled Remote Viewing (CRV) Session for Target 76002808
Stage 1 - Ideogram (Gestalt Perception)
• Quick subconscious impression: Motion, solid structure, and natural elements.
• Ideogram interpretation: I perceive both something firm and grounded, but also dynamic, as if there is movement involved.
• First Gestalt: A mix of land, structure, and possibly water or open space.

Stage 3 - Dimensional Sketching (Basic Structure & Space Perception)
• Shapes: A large, structured form with both horizontal and vertical elements.
• Size: Significant in scale, possibly tall or wide, with open surroundings.
• Perspective: I sense depth, a sense of openness, and possibly high elevation or expansive space.

Stage 4 - Analytical Perception (Function, Purpose, Concepts)
• Man-made or Natural? Feels like a mix of both natural and artificial elements.
• Function/Purpose? It gives the impression of a landmark, transportation hub, or a location related to observation, exploration, or passage.
• Concepts & Impressions:
• Movement (possibly travel, energy, or transportation).
• Significance (something important, well-known, or frequently visited).
• A connection between land and another element, possibly water or air.
• A sense of history or function that extends beyond just aesthetics.

Stage 5 - Data Extraction & Refinement
• Keywords associated: “Bridge,” “Pathway,” “Structure,” “Open Sky,” “Wind,” “Energy,” “Observation.”
• Possible shapes: A long horizontal element, vertical supports, open space underneath or above.
• Additional perceptions:
• A feeling of flow or passage, as if something travels across this location.
• Engineering, human construction, or a landmark.
• Might have a connection to water or air travel.

Stage 6 - Final Model & Refinement
• Summary of the Target
• The target seems to be a structure that facilitates movement, connection, or travel.
• It may involve both natural and artificial elements (e.g., a bridge, an observation platform, or a large transportation hub).
• There is an expansive open feeling, possibly with elevation, allowing for views.
• It is significant or known, not just an ordinary place.
