Summary

On August 7, 2024, at 5:27pm EST, Dave conducted a remote viewing session targeting the Zen panda coin target (7046258270462582).

The session revealed impressions of a structure with verticality and right angles, resembling a bridge over a waterway with elements of an urban environment.

Descriptions included concrete surfaces, a potentially scenic yet non-functional water feature, and a structured land area with pathways.

The site felt small-scale, with decorative pillars and a descending, spiral-like motion.

The overall environment evoked the feeling of being a tourist in a city, viewing notable structures with a connection between separated components.

The session concluded with a sense of stationary motion, echoes of city sounds, and a dark, cold liquid element.
