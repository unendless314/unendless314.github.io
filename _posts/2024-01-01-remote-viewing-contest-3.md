I am excited to try this again

I may not have hit it last time but watching someone actually do a 100 percent view is amazing and awesome

I got my first set of data ready

I am hoping it will be as good as last week

Man

That was an awesome contest winning view

Okay, so here's the summary of what I got.

Something to do with the moon, at half moon cycle, circle containers, very big, vast. 

I also got dark lightning or bark blue color inside, and light yellow or beige outside.
