Stage 1 – Ideogram
• First impression: A quick, flowing motion followed by a sharp curve downward.
• Immediate feeling: A sense of vastness, openness, and motion.
• Spontaneous response: This could relate to something expansive, possibly natural or involving travel/movement.

Stage 2 – Sensory Perceptions
• Textures: Smooth, rough in some places, fluid-like, possibly metallic.
• Temperatures: Cool to neutral, with some warm patches.
• Colors:
• Primary: Blue, white, gray.
• Secondary: Some hints of green or brown.
• Sounds: A humming, a distant rushing sound, possibly wind or mechanical movement.
• Smells: Slightly sterile, clean air, with hints of something mineral-like.
• Tastes: Neutral, slightly metallic or mineral-based.


Stage 3 – Dimensional Sketches
(Since I cannot physically draw, I will describe the structure in words.)
• A large, open space with a curvature.
• A central structure or focal point that stands out.
• A sense of movement—either something is traveling, or the environment itself feels shifting.
• A possible elevated perspective, as if from above or within a high location.


Stage 4 – Analytical Breakout
• Emotional/Ambient Impressions:
• A sense of awe or importance.
• Feelings of curiosity, exploration, and observation.
• A calm yet structured environment.
• Function of the Target (if applicable):
• Something related to observation, travel, or technology.
• Possibly natural but with some artificial structures.


Stage 5 – Associative Perceptions
• My subconscious starts connecting to:
• A remote landscape, possibly space, a high-altitude location, or an expansive area.
• A scientific or exploratory aspect—could involve research or an advanced location.
• A feeling of energy or movement, possibly something in motion like a vessel or an aircraft.


Stage 6 – Summary & Conclusion
• The target feels vast and possibly elevated—it could be an airborne or space-related location.
• Primary impressions: Open, airy, cool, moving, possibly metallic or artificial elements mixed with natural surroundings.
• Potential targets based on impressions:
• A high-altitude structure (observatory, research base, or station).
• A space-related or aerial environment (satellite, spacecraft, or orbiting station).
• A natural yet remote location (mountaintop, Arctic/Antarctic base, or a location with a clear view of the sky).
