89221110.
I've never posted a reply in here before so excuse me if I'm doing this wrong but the first thing I see associated with this was something that reminded me of an air base, but it focused on the helicopter propellers or the propellers on an older plane, then that focus sorta morphed into a windmill.  I then saw it develop a little bit into a grasslands type area where the windmills sit.  Sorry, this just popped up and I closed my eyes and got this response.  Please forgive me if I'm doing this wrong.

I don't know why I chose to do this now, I don't feel one way or another about what I saw, I mean I don't know if I feel I'm on target or off until I see it when the view is over.  I just do it how I normally do it...it's kinda what I've heard a lot of you refer as the cowboy style of viewing.  I associate w lot on my visuals not as much in the environment.  It was quick and it's what I saw.  So I guess I'll just wait for the review when it's done.
