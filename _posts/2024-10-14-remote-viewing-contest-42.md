### CIVIL UNREST, OUTBREAK OF PHYSICAL FIGHTING BETWEEN POLITICAL PARTIES / UNITED STATES / NEAR FUTURE

FONNER STONES SOLSTICE CEREMONY / FONNER WOODS, TERRAPIN / JUNE 21, 2025

If there is civil war, unrest, political violence between parties in the United States in the near future, then the viewer will perceive a bright sunrise, with beams of sunlight coming from the northeast horizon through Fonner Pass, with thousands of people at a festive ceremony. The sun will reflect off mirrors held by participants at the Solstice Event. The viewer will hear gongs sounding, bells ringing, and will see maidens dancing, birds being released from cages, and people tossing handfuls of wheat into the air. A celebration.

If the U.S. is peaceful in the near future, the sunrise will be obscured by clouds and rain. No one will see the sunrise.The stone monuments will appear dull and static. There will be wind. The site will be quiet, with only a very few people present. The birds will remain caged. Those people will be in tents, sheltered from wind and rain. The mood of the few people there will be disappointed and somber.
